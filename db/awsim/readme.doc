Convert awsim parametric data into build script.

Header file
First line has AWSIM parameter names. Copy from first line of input file.  (If header file exists, compare)
Second line has corresponding RESA parameter name
Third line has default value(s) for null parameter.
Additional RESA parameters may be appended to end of header lines

There is currently no provision for change of units.  It appears AWSIM and
RESA use the same units. A forth header line could be added to specify
conversion of units.

Input file
Input file is comma delimited. From Excel, save as msdos cvs file
First line has AWSIM parameter names.

awsimbuild program requires 5 arguments
   build type
   CAT
   header file
   comma deliminted input file name
   build script output file

CAT is used if the input file does not contain CAT parameter in second field.
Caret (^) in cat field causes program to ignore CAT argument.

Example: awsimbuild ship ^ aship.txt aship.scr
         awsimbuild radar/esm radar aradar.txt aradar.scr 

BUG: If last field in default header line is empty, there must be at least one
space after comma.

@awsimbuild.com proceses *.txt files into *.scr files

AWSIM air characteristics needed to be divided into 3 files for jet, prop, helo.

AWSIM names are made legitimate RESA names and shortened to 8 characters if
necessary.

  jammr + jammrfreq

Radar power attributed range changed from 0-90 to 0-100 to accommodate AWSIM
value range.

jammr.csv

A dummy freq is entered so the jammer entry is created.
The ajammrfreq.csv needs to be hand edited.
  1. the comma between freq and band needs to be replaced by space
  2. the header file (.hdr) needs two column name freq.  BAND needs to be eliminated since freq and band are on same line

The ajammrfreq.scr needs to be hand edited.
  1. Eliminate delete entry line.  A blank line is OK.
  2. Eliminate NAME line. A jammer name on line will be rejected.
  3. Copy ajammrfreq.scr to end of ajammr.scr  (each freq line is an update to the jammer entry)
