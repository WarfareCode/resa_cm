Setup

1. Sign on to Linux server Alpha1
    ssh -X resa@alpha1
    <password>
    gwar

2. Create ATO WS 7 window
    Sign on to Linux server Alpha1
    vsta 7 c as=1 config=cciox

3. Create ATO Procedure window
    Sign on to Linux server Alpha1
    atomissions
        Note: This will give you procedure syntax

4. Create ATO Fix window
    Sign on to Linux server Alpha1

5. In navy account home directory, start atopermissions
    /opt/resa/resa_build/resang/trunk/atopermissions.py /home/navy
    This procedure sets file permissions so that resa account can read files.

--------------------------------------------------------------- 
resabashrc file 

The file $RESA_HOME/resabashrc file is called by .bashrc
This file contains environment variables, aliases for resa programs, Linux command short-cuts and
station definitions.
Commonly used Linux command short-cuts are
  1. gwar - go to game directory
  2. gresa - go to resa source code directory
  3. ldir  - list directories in current directory

---------------------------------------------------------------  
ATO Input Files

The ATO input directory structure follows the structure used in Osan.
<atoid (4 letters)>
	<atoid update number (0-9)>
		<atoid>.<atoid update number>
		ACO.<atoid>.<atoid update number>
		LASTFILE

The LASTFILE must be the last file sent by Osan signaling that the ato is ready for processing.
The <atoid>.<atoid update number> contains the air missions for all countries and all services.
RESA processes US naval missions.
The ACO.<atoid>.<atoid update number> contains airspace definitions that are referenced in missions.
Either ACO file or ATO file is optional.

---------------------------------------------------------------  
ATO Config Files

The config files are located in game directory.

The basic format rules:
	# in column 1 is a comment
	Whitespace between fields
	One line for each action
	No action continuation on multiple lines
	Multiple actions may not appear on one line
	Mappings are in <from ATO> to <to RESA> order

1. atoairmap.dat
	Map aircraft types.
	RESA uses ATO aircraft type if no mapping.
	 
2. atobasemap.dat		
	Map launching and recovery platforms

3. atoid.dat
	The last line in this file contains the unique suffix character added to missions of the associated atoid.
	This file is automatically updated when new ato received.
	This file should be deleted before start of exercise.

4. atoloadaugment.dat
	This file augments a mission load based on aircraft type and mission.
	Aircraft type and mission fields accept wildcard *.
	Use repeating <quantity> <item> for augmentation items.
	This file is specifically designed to augment ASW missions with passive and active sonobuoys since sonobuoyse are not considered weapons and are not included in ATO.

5. atotimeshift.dat
	This file will shift time from ATO by given days hours and minutes.
	Typically this file will contain one line
		0 -9 0 
	which converts ato local time (india time) into Zulu Time.
	The exercise always uses Zulu time.

6. atoweaponmap.dat
	Maps weapon types

7. atocountrycode.dat
	Country codes after TSKCNTRY keyword in raw ATO to not be processed.
	Usually the file will only contain KS (S. Korea) since S. Korea is federate. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATO Missions Procedure

This procedure controls the entire ATO process.
This procedure is designed to run un-interrupted for the duration of the exercise.
To start this procedure: 
	atomissions -r /home/navy 7
For procedure syntax:
	atomissions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATO Mission Files generated  by atomissions.py procedure

The Mission Files are located in the ATO working directory under game/ato/<atoid>/<atoid update>

<mission>.pre

This file contains the RESA orders for the single specified mission.
In comments below RESA order is the USMFT mission definition.
This file may be modified to correct any problems with the mission and then re-entered with cntrl-f

Missions flown by AWSIM do not have a <mission>.pre file.
AWSIM flies all missions with type: XINT, XCAS, XATK, XAEW, AEW, EW, WW 

<mission>.usmtf

This file contains the USMTF mission definition which is also appended to <mission>.pre file.

nm.pre

This file contains airspace definition orders, RESA orders for all missions and replenish orders if requested.
Since every airspace definition and mission are preceded by a delete,  this file may be re-entered before 6AM. Re-entry of all missions is only needed if there is a problem affecting many missions.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATO ASTAB

1. SHOW AIR ATO 1 BLUE 4 

2. SHOW AIR ATO 1 BLUE 3
    Note: This is sub view for CM launches

3. SHOW AIR MISSION 1 BLUE 4
	This displays aircraft mission history

4. SHOW AIR EVENTS 1 BLUE 4
	This displays aircraft after resource allocation and in flight

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATO Output Reports

Located in ATO working directory e.g. $RESA_HOME/game/ato/KSA2/0

1. atoerrors.out
	Summary of insufficient or no resources for ATO.
	Input is atostats.out and error message appended to input records.
2. atomissing.out
	List of missing missions determined by comparing missions in BB with missions in ATO

3. atostats.out
	Summary of resources needed for ATO by platform

4. atoheader.out
	Contains atoid and update number for output to printer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add aircraft to base

If an aircraft type is missing or insufficient aircraft,
 use ENTER AIR to add available aircraft to base.

See $RESA_HOME/db/kr15/kr15a.txt (force file) for ENTER AIR orders at game initialization

ENTER AIR <2 letter side number prefix> <starting side number sequence>
          <side number count> <ac type>
	  <launching platform> <time flown> <up time> <squadron>

Example: ENTER AIR GW 100 20 FA18C NNGW 0 0 GW100

 Note:  The 2 letter side number prefix uniquely identifies launching platform
	The side numbers must be unique.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add weapon to base

FOR <force> ADD [|CHAFF | COUNTERMEASURE | CRUISE | TORPEDOES | WEAPONS] ITEM <qty> <weapon>

Note: The type of item is optional.  This is only needed to resolved different
      types of items with same name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replenish weapon on base

FOR <force> REPLENISH TO <qty> <weapon>
